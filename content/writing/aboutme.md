Hi, I'm Dilip Dawadi, a Full-Stack Software Developer with over 3.5 years of experience building modern web applications. I specialize in React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and cloud technologies.

Currently based in Toronto, Canada, I'm passionate about creating efficient, scalable solutions and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies in web development.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.

Feel free to check out my [projects](/projects) or [get in touch](/contact) if you'd like to collaborate!
